This github repository is a re-implementation of the NIC paper's neural network model for capturing text
from images. We have trained 6 different types of alterations to the NIC model that utilizes augmentations
and different model architect comparisons. Additionally, we have provided predictions with Sampling, BeamSearch,
and Nucleus Sampling. The source code has our implementation of vocabulary, dataloader, and various other items
that we wanted to build by scratch along with some segments from various authors on the web, which we credited
in-line code. Unfortunately, the trained models and vocabulary files were too big to upload to github. Feel free
to download these models https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ZjCOAblFVJPRX3ZECeDsVRSTRjJaE3T?usp=sharing.
